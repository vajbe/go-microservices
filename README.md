**Go Based Microservices Demonstration:**

Tech Stack:
  1. Go lang
  2. Postgres DB
  3. Kafka
  4. Docker
  5. Kubernetes
  6. Redis

**Domain** : E-commerce

**Key Concepts to be demonstrated:**

**Phase 1**
RESTful API Development 
1. Routing, controllers, middleware
2. Database relationships (e.g., users, posts, orders)
3. Authentication (JWT, OAuth2)
4. Pagination, filtering, and sorting

**Phase 2**
Microservices Architecture
1. Service-to-service communication (REST, gRPC, Kafka)
2. API gateway
3. Service discovery and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes)
4. Event-driven architecture


**Use cases Plannned:**

Phase 1: Set up User Authentication & Product Catalog microservices.

Phase 2: Implement Order Management and Inventory microservices.

Phase 3: Add Notification microservices.

Phase 4: Set up API Gateway, integrate service discovery, and deploy using Docker/Kubernetes.

Phase 5: Implement Admin Dashboard and Reporting microservices.

Phase 6: Add search functionality and optimize for scalability.
